I have decided too make this version 1.0

Fixed in this version
* Graphics drawn in the programs client area now don't get erased
* Attempting to close a file didn't work if you attempted to open twice
* A few other minor problems

New Features
* MPLAB has been releaved of rectangle drawing and filling duties resulting
  in much faster operation
* GFXDisplaySimulator changes its size and orientation automatically, depending on
  the defined values of DISP_HOR_RESOLUTION and DISP_VER_RESOLUTION in
  HardwareProfile.h These values are sent to GFXDisplaySimulator when DeviceReset()
  is called in the PIC program
* Program now has close and minimise buttons
* Inlcuded a modified version of slider.c with nop's inserted between math operations
  to mitigate a bug with PIC32 MPSIM as an example

Isues
* Bitmaps are still outputed from MPLAB using the PutPixel fucntion which makes them
  very slow. Cant figure out a way for MPLAB to dump large amounts of data quickly
* When GFXDisplaySimulator is monitoring out.txt it is constantly reading the EOF
  of this file so that it can tell when new data has been written to it.
  I have tried windows FindFirstChangeNotification() function but it misses data writes
  resulting in incomplete rendering of objects.
  A consequence of this is increased CPU load and file access which causes MPLAB to be
  even slower in writing data to out.txt (about 50% slower)
* Haven't included accelerated line, arc, circle etc yet. Its on the todo list but
  I'd like to sort out the above 2 issues first
